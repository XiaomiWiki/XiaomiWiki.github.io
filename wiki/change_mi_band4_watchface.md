## Changing watchfaces on the Mi Band 4
This is a guide to change the watchfaces on your Mi Band 4. We'll refer watchfaces as WF from now on.
### Custom WF

If you think the watchfaces included in the Mi Fit app aren't anything you like, then you might be interested in getting a custom one. It is very simple to do so.

# Installing
Step 1. Download https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.html.watchfaceinstaller

Step 2. Once it's installed, open it.

Step 3. Press "Choose File".

Step 4. Press the WF you want to install.

Step 5. Press save to Mi Fit.

Step 6. It will tell you which band display to select on Mi Fit. Now, navigate to that WF.


### Stock WF
If you dont want to do the effort to install a custom one (The guide that I showed you is extremely simple, by the way), you can get a watchface made by Xiaomi. This is even simpler, but however, some watchfaces are locked down by region.

# Installing 
Step 1. Open Mi Fit

Step 2. Navigate to profile

Step 3. Tap on your band

Step 4. Scroll down until you find Band display

Step 5. Tap that, and find a WF you like.

Step 6. Tap that WF and press install.

PS: I dont use Mi Fit anymore, so this is straight from my brain.
