## Disable ads in MIUI

Advertising is an integral part of Xiaomiâ€™s internet services, a key component in their business model and one of their sources of income. As such, MIUI and Mi apps contain ads by default which may appear in places where you wouldn't expect to see them, like in Settings. Thankfully, there are ways to get rid of them.

### Instructions

1. Uninstall MSA and every factory app you don't need or use.

    Most factory apps cannot be uninstalled directly on the phone but you can use the [Xiaomi ADB/Fastboot Tools](Uninstall_system_apps.md) to remove them.

2. Go to the settings of remaining Mi apps and disable recommendations.

    Example: Security > Settings > Receive recommendations

    Example: File Manager > Settings > About > Recommendations

3. Go to Settings > Additional settings > Authorization & revocation and revoke authorization for all apps.

4. Go to Settings > Additional settings > Privacy > Ad services and disable personalized ad recommendations.

5. Go to Settings > Additional settings > Region and set it to a Western country.

    Note: Choosing an E.U. country will disable the Themes app.
