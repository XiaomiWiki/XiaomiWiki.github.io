## Flash TWRP & custom ROMs

TWRP is a custom recovery that replaces MiRecovery / the splash screen for the Mi PC Suite. A custom recovery mode gives the user more options to manage the device's system, more options to flash ROMs, wipe, or back up. A custom recovery, such as TWRP, is needed to flash ROMs, kernels, etc. or root.

### Use TWRP without flashing it

**Requirements:** [unlocked bootloader](Unlock_the_bootloader.md)

1. Download and if needed, unzip the image file of the recovery that you want to flash. If a custom ROM requires a specific build of TWRP to be flashed, that is noted by the developer on XDA.

    Devices are referred to by their codenames, if you don't know the codename of the device, see [this](https://i.imgur.com/iZoFg2t.png).
