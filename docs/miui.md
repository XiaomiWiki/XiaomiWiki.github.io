## MIUI explained

### About MIUI

MIUI is Xiaomi's own custom Android interface which runs on most of their devices by default. MIUI is also the second most widely available custom Android ROM in the world. It's getting updated weekly and the development is very community-oriented. All news, suggestions and feedback are posted and collected on the MIUI forums and the community does the testing as well. As a result, there are updates every week, containing bug fixes and new features. MIUI receives a major update once a year, in a similar fashion to Android. The design of the UI differs from Google's Material Design and resembles iOS to some degree.

All Xiaomi devices that are bought in Mainland China come with this type of ROM out of the box. It has Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Tibetan and English languages. It doesn't have Google Play Store or any Google services pre-installed because Google and its services are blocked in China. Instead, it has Baidu, Weibo and other Chinese counterpart apps and services.

 * **China Developer/Beta**

It's the same as the Global Stable ROM, but it's getting updated on a weekly basis and has the latest new features and updates of MIUI. Despite being called Developer/Beta, it's absolutely stable, suitable for daily use.

Global Developer ROMs do not pass SafetyNet or get Google Play Certification, regardless of the status of the bootloader. That's their only drawback compared to Global Stable ROMs.
